Issue with interpreter and input command

Hello, I have entered the program and the grader accepted it but the output of my interpreter has an issue. 
Each time the program cycles through the input function then it leaves a blank line above.
For example this is the output shown on my end:

Is your secret number 50?

Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high.
Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. l

Is your secret number 75? Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. 
Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. 
Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. l


I did read about it online to try to solve it but it seems there's an issue/bug with the interpreter and didn't find a concise way to fix it
 I am just wondering if anybody else has the issue and/or knows how to solve it.
